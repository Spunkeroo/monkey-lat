    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Why are my homemade churros not crispy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The most common reason homemade churros are not crispy is oil temperature. If the oil is below 360F, churros absorb oil and become soggy instead of crispy. Use a thermometer and keep the oil between 360-375F. Other causes include too much moisture in the dough (add slightly less water next time) or not frying long enough. Churros need 3-4 minutes of frying until they are deep golden brown, not just light gold."}},

Pipe the dough into churro shapes, brush with melted butter, and bake until golden. Baked churros are lighter and less greasy but will not have the same crispy exterior as fried churros. For the closest fried texture, brush with butter before and after baking and broil for the last 1-2 minutes."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do homemade churros last?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Homemade churros are best eaten within 30 minutes of frying while they are still warm and crispy. They begin losing crispiness after about an hour. You can store leftover churros in an airtight container for up to 2 days and reheat in a 375F oven for 5-7 minutes to restore some crispiness. You can also freeze unfried churro dough for up to 3 months. Pipe the shapes, freeze on a baking sheet, then transfer to a freezer bag. Fry from frozen, adding 1-2 minutes to the fry time."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What kind of oil is best for frying churros?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil are all excellent for frying churros. They have high smoke points and neutral flavors that will not overpower the cinnamon-sugar coating. You need about 2-3 inches of oil in your pot. Avoid olive oil (too low a smoke point and strong flavor) and coconut oil (adds coconut flavor). Peanut oil gives the crispiest results but costs more."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do I need a churro maker or piping bag to make churros?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A piping bag with a large open star tip is the easiest way to pipe churros. If you do not have one, use a large zip-lock bag with a corner cut off for a smooth churro, or press a star tip into the cut corner. You can also use a cookie press or churrera. In a pinch, you can shape churros by hand by rolling dough into logs, though you will not get the classic ridged texture that helps churros stay crispy."}}

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients You Need</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Churro Dough</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup water (240 ml)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour (125g)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional but recommended)</li>
<li>1 large egg (optional, makes churros richer and more tender)</li>
<li>Vegetable or canola oil for frying (enough for 2-3 inches in your pot)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Cinnamon-Sugar Coating</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Mexican Chocolate Dipping Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 oz semi-sweet or dark chocolate, chopped (or chocolate chips)</li>
<li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional, for a Mexican kick)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>That is it. You probably have most of this in your pantry right now. If you need any specialty items, grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mexican+chocolate+abuelita&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">Mexican chocolate (Abuelita or Ibarra brand)</a> for the most authentic dipping sauce, or use regular chocolate chips. Both work great.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment You Need</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven</strong> for frying (at least 4 inches deep)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=piping+bag+star+tip+set&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">Piping bag with a large open star tip</a></strong> (1/2 inch or 1M tip works perfectly). No piping bag? Use a gallon zip-lock bag with a corner cut off.</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen thermometer</strong> for oil temperature (this is the single most important tool for perfect churros)</li>
<li><strong>Slotted spoon or spider strainer</strong> to remove churros from oil</li>
<li><strong>Paper towels</strong> on a wire rack or plate for draining</li>
<li><strong>Shallow dish</strong> for the cinnamon-sugar coating</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dough">Step 1: Making the Churro Dough</h2>

<p>This is a choux-style dough, which means you cook the flour in liquid on the stove before piping and frying. It sounds fancy but it is incredibly easy. Here is exactly what to do.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Combine the wet ingredients:</strong> In a medium saucepan, combine the water, sugar, salt, and butter. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a full rolling boil. Stir occasionally to make sure the butter melts completely and the sugar dissolves.</li>
<li><strong>Add the flour all at once:</strong> Once the mixture is at a full boil, remove the pan from the heat. Add all the flour at once. Yes, all of it. Dump it in.</li>
<li><strong>Stir vigorously:</strong> Using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir the mixture aggressively. Within 30-60 seconds, the dough will come together into a smooth ball that pulls away from the sides of the pan. It should look like a thick, smooth paste with no lumps.</li>
<li><strong>Let it cool slightly:</strong> Let the dough rest for 2-3 minutes. If you are adding an egg (recommended for a richer, more tender churro), this cooling step is important so the egg does not scramble.</li>
<li><strong>Add vanilla and egg:</strong> Stir in the vanilla extract. If using an egg, add it and stir vigorously until fully incorporated. The dough will look like it is falling apart at first, but keep stirring and it will come back together into a smooth, thick dough. This takes about 30-45 seconds of stirring.</li>
</ol>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>The Dough Consistency Test</h3>
<p>Your dough should be thick enough to hold its shape when piped but soft enough to squeeze through a star tip without Herculean effort. If it is too thick, add a teaspoon of water at a time and stir. If it is too thin (rare), add a tablespoon of flour. The dough should look like thick mashed potatoes.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="piping">Step 2: Piping the Churros</h2>

<p>Transfer the warm dough into your piping bag fitted with the star tip. If you do not have a piping bag, spoon the dough into a large zip-lock bag, squeeze it to one corner, and cut about a 1/2 inch off the corner. You will not get the ridged texture without a star tip, but the churros will still taste amazing.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pipe the dough</strong> into 5-6 inch strips directly onto the parchment paper. The classic churro shape is a straight stick, but you can also pipe circles, loops, or even letters. Squeeze firmly and evenly for consistent thickness.</li>
<li><strong>You can fry them right away</strong> or refrigerate the piped churros for up to 2 hours before frying. Chilling makes them a bit easier to handle when transferring to the oil.</li>
</ol>

<div class="warn-box">
<h3>Safety Note: Piping Directly Into Oil</h3>
<p>Some recipes tell you to pipe churro dough directly into hot oil. This works but it is risky if you are not experienced. The hot oil can splash, and holding a piping bag over a pot of 370-degree oil is nerve-wracking. Piping onto parchment first and then gently sliding them into the oil is much safer and gives you more control over the shape and size.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="frying">Step 3: Frying to Golden Perfection</h2>

<p>This is where the magic happens. And where most people mess up. The key is <strong>oil temperature</strong>. If your oil is not hot enough, the churros absorb oil and become greasy and soggy. If it is too hot, the outside burns while the inside stays raw.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Heat 2-3 inches of oil</strong> in your pot to <strong>360-375 degrees F (180-190 degrees C)</strong>. Use a thermometer. Do not guess.</li>
<li><strong>Fry 3-5 churros at a time.</strong> Do not overcrowd the pot. Each churro needs space to float and cook evenly. Overcrowding drops the oil temperature and results in greasy churros.</li>
<li><strong>Gently slide churros into the oil</strong> from the parchment paper. Use tongs or a spatula to help.</li>
<li><strong>Fry for 3-4 minutes total</strong>, turning once or twice, until they are <strong>deep golden brown</strong> all over. Not light gold. Deep, rich golden brown. That color means the outside is crispy and the inside is cooked through.</li>
<li><strong>Remove with a slotted spoon</strong> and drain briefly on paper towels for about 10 seconds. Do not let them sit on paper towels too long or the paper sticks.</li>
<li><strong>Immediately roll in cinnamon-sugar</strong> while still hot and slightly oily. The coating sticks best when the churros are fresh out of the fryer.</li>
</ol>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>The Oil Temperature Secret</h3>
<p>Between batches, let the oil come back up to 365-370 degrees F before adding the next batch. This is the number one reason some churros come out perfect and others come out soggy in the same batch. Use your thermometer obsessively. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=instant+read+kitchen+thermometer&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">good kitchen thermometer</a> costs less than $15 and is the difference between perfect and disappointing churros every single time.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="coating">Step 4: The Cinnamon-Sugar Coating</h2>

<p>Mix 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon in a shallow dish or plate. While the churros are still warm and slightly oily from frying, roll them in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Coat every surface. The slight oil on the surface makes the sugar stick perfectly.</p>

<p>Serve immediately. Churros are at their absolute best within the first 15-20 minutes after frying. The outside is shatteringly crispy, the inside is soft and tender, and the cinnamon-sugar creates this incredible sweet crunch with every bite.</p>

<h2 id="chocolate-sauce">Chocolate Dipping Sauce Recipe</h2>

<p>Churros without chocolate sauce are like fries without ketchup. Technically fine, but you are missing half the experience. This sauce takes 5 minutes and is absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Heat the heavy cream</strong> in a small saucepan over medium heat until it just starts to simmer (small bubbles around the edges). Do not let it boil.</li>
<li><strong>Remove from heat</strong> and add the chopped chocolate. Let it sit for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
<li><strong>Stir gently</strong> until the chocolate is completely melted and the sauce is smooth and glossy.</li>
<li><strong>Add cinnamon, cayenne (if using), and vanilla.</strong> Stir to combine.</li>
<li><strong>Serve warm</strong> in small dipping bowls alongside the churros.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a truly authentic Mexican chocolate sauce, replace the chocolate chips with one disk of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=abuelita+mexican+chocolate&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">Abuelita or Ibarra Mexican chocolate</a>. Mexican chocolate already has cinnamon and sugar in it, so you can skip the added cinnamon and just heat it with cream. The flavor is warmer and more complex than regular chocolate.</p>

<h2 id="variations">5 Creative Churro Variations</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>1. Churro Bites</h3>
<p>Instead of piping long sticks, pipe the dough in 1-inch nuggets directly into the oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes. Toss in cinnamon-sugar. These are perfect for parties, snacking, and dipping. Kids love these because they are bite-sized.</p>
</div>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>2. Churro Ice Cream Sandwiches</h3>
<p>Pipe and fry two flat, wide churro discs (about 3 inches across). Coat in cinnamon-sugar. Place a scoop of vanilla ice cream between two churro discs. Press gently. The warm, crispy churro with cold ice cream is one of the best desserts you will ever eat.</p>
</div>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>3. Filled Churros (Churros Rellenos)</h3>
<p>Use a pastry bag with a long, thin tip to inject fillings into cooked churros. Popular fillings: dulce de leche, Nutella, pastry cream, or strawberry jam. Poke a hole in one end of the fried churro with a chopstick, insert the tip, and squeeze. This is how many Mexican churrerias serve them.</p>
</div>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>4. Churro Waffles</h3>
<p>Press churro dough into a waffle iron and cook until golden and crispy. The star pattern from the piping creates ridges that trap the cinnamon-sugar. Top with whipped cream, fruit, and chocolate sauce for an insane brunch dish.</p>
</div>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>5. Baked Churro Sticks with White Chocolate Drizzle</h3>
<p>Pipe churro shapes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with melted butter. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-18 minutes. Roll in cinnamon-sugar. Drizzle with melted white chocolate. A lighter alternative that still satisfies the churro craving.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Common Problems</h2>

<div class="warn-box">
<h3>Churros Are Soggy or Greasy</h3>
<p>Your oil was not hot enough. It needs to be 360-375 degrees F. Use a thermometer. Also, do not overcrowd the pot. Too many churros at once drop the temperature rapidly.</p>
</div>

<div class="warn-box">
<h3>Churros Are Raw Inside</h3>
<p>Either your oil was too hot (outside cooked too fast) or your churros were too thick. Keep oil at 365-370 degrees F and pipe churros no thicker than 3/4 inch in diameter.</p>
</div>

<div class="warn-box">
<h3>Dough Comes Out of the Piping Bag Smoothly but Churros Do Not Hold Shape</h3>
<p>Your dough is too wet. Add 1-2 tablespoons more flour and mix well. The dough should hold a firm shape when piped and not spread or flatten.</p>
</div>

<div class="warn-box">
<h3>Dough Is Too Stiff to Pipe</h3>
<p>Your dough is too dry. Add 1 teaspoon of water at a time and mix until you can pipe with firm but not extreme pressure. The dough should be stiff but workable.</p>
</div>

<div class="warn-box">
<h3>Cinnamon-Sugar Does Not Stick</h3>
<p>You waited too long after frying. The sugar sticks best when churros are still warm and have a thin film of oil on the surface. Roll them in the coating within 10-15 seconds of removing from the oil.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="baked">Baked Churros Alternative</h2>

<p>If you want to skip the frying, baked churros are a solid alternative. They will not be quite as crispy as fried, but they are still delicious and much less messy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Make the dough exactly as described above.</li>
<li>Pipe the dough into 5-6 inch strips on the parchment paper, leaving 1 inch between each churro.</li>
<li>Brush each churro generously with melted butter on all sides.</li>
<li>Bake for 15-18 minutes until golden brown and firm to the touch.</li>
<li>Remove from oven and immediately roll in cinnamon-sugar.</li>
<li>Optional: broil for 1-2 minutes at the end for extra crispiness. Watch closely so they do not burn.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="storage">How to Store and Reheat Churros</h2>

<p>Churros are best fresh. Period. But if you have leftovers or want to make them ahead, here is how:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Room temperature:</strong> Store in an airtight container for up to 24 hours. They will lose crispiness but can be revived.</li>
<li><strong>Reheat:</strong> Place on a wire rack over a baking sheet in a 375 degrees F oven for 5-7 minutes. This restores a lot of the crispiness. Do not microwave, which makes them rubbery.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze dough:</strong> Pipe unfried churro shapes onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, freeze until solid (about 2 hours), then transfer to freezer bags. Fry from frozen, adding 1-2 minutes to the fry time. This is a game-changer for parties because you can prep days in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze fried churros:</strong> Let fried churros cool completely, place in freezer bags, and freeze for up to 2 months. Reheat in a 400 degrees F oven for 8-10 minutes. Do not coat in cinnamon-sugar until after reheating.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common reason is oil temperature. If the oil is below 360 degrees F, churros absorb oil and become soggy. Use a thermometer and keep the oil between 360-375 degrees F. Also make sure you fry until deep golden brown, not just light gold. That extra minute of frying makes all the difference in crispiness.</p>

<h3>Can I bake churros instead of frying them?</h3>
<p>Yes. Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-18 minutes on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush with melted butter before baking. Baked churros are lighter but will not have the same crispy exterior as fried. Broil for 1-2 minutes at the end for extra crunch.</p>

<h3>How long do homemade churros last?</h3>
<p>Homemade churros are best within 30 minutes of frying. They start losing crispiness after about an hour. Store leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days and reheat in a 375 degrees F oven for 5-7 minutes. You can also freeze unfried dough for up to 3 months and fry from frozen.</p>

<h3>What kind of oil is best for frying churros?</h3>
<p>Vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil all work great. They have high smoke points and neutral flavors. You need 2-3 inches of oil in your pot. Avoid olive oil (too low a smoke point) and coconut oil (adds coconut flavor). Peanut oil gives the crispiest results.</p>

<h3>Do I need a piping bag to make churros?</h3>
<p>A piping bag with a large open star tip is the easiest method. If you do not have one, use a large zip-lock bag with a corner cut off. You will not get the classic ridged texture without a star tip, but the churros will still taste amazing. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=piping+bag+star+tip+set&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">piping bag set with tips</a> costs under $10 and is worth every penny.</p>

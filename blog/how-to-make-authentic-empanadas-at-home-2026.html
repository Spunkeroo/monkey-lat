<h2 id="why-homemade">Why Homemade Empanadas Beat Everything Else</h2>

<p>Here is the truth about store-bought empanadas: they are fine. Frozen empanadas from the grocery store will get the job done in a pinch. But once you taste a homemade empanada with fresh dough and a filling you made yourself, there is no going back.</p>

<p>The dough is the biggest difference. Store-bought empanada discs are made in a factory months ago and frozen. They work, but they do not have that buttery, flaky quality that fresh dough gives you. Homemade dough takes maybe 15 minutes to put together, and the result is night and day.</p>

<p>Then there is the filling. When you make it yourself, you control the seasoning, the quality of the meat, the ratio of ingredients. You can make them as spicy or mild as you want. You can use that amazing cheese from the farmer's market or the peppers from your garden.</p>

<p>The best part? Empanadas are a social food. Make a big batch with friends or family. Set up an assembly line. Put on some music. It turns cooking into a party.</p>

<p>And if you are worried about it being hard, do not be. Empanadas are one of the most forgiving foods to make. Even if your folding is not perfect or your dough is a little thick, they still taste great. The bar for a "bad" empanada is really, really low.</p>

<h2 id="dough">The Perfect Empanada Dough (Two Ways)</h2>

<p>There are two main types of empanada dough: one for baking and one for frying. They are similar but have a few key differences that make each one better for its cooking method.</p>

<h3>Baked Empanada Dough (Argentine Style)</h3>

<p>This is the dough you want for oven-baked empanadas. It is flaky, buttery, and almost pastry-like. Think of it as a savory pie crust that can hold a generous filling without falling apart.</p>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Baked Empanada Dough</h3>
<p><strong>Makes about 18-20 empanadas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup ice water (you might not need all of it)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Whisk the flour and salt together in a big bowl. Add the cold butter cubes and work them into the flour with your fingers or a pastry cutter until you have a crumbly texture with pea-sized butter pieces. Beat the egg with the water and vinegar, then pour it into the flour mixture. Stir with a fork until it comes together into a shaggy dough. Knead it just a few times until smooth. Do not overwork it. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</p>
</div>

<p>The vinegar is the secret ingredient here. It makes the dough more tender and helps it stay flaky. The cold butter is important too. Those little butter pieces melt in the oven and create pockets of steam that puff the dough up.</p>

<h3>Fried Empanada Dough (Colombian Style)</h3>

<p>For frying, you want a slightly different dough. This one uses a bit more fat and no egg. It fries up golden and crunchy without absorbing too much oil.</p>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Fried Empanada Dough</h3>
<p><strong>Makes about 18-20 empanadas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups masarepa (pre-cooked corn flour, not regular cornmeal)</li>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening, softened</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Mix the masarepa, flour, salt, and sugar. Add the lard and rub it into the dry ingredients. Gradually add warm water, mixing until you have a soft, pliable dough that does not stick to your hands. If it cracks when you fold it, add a tiny bit more water. Let it rest 15 minutes before using.</p>
</div>

<p>Colombian empanadas use masarepa (pre-cooked corn flour like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=masarepa+corn+flour&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P.A.N. brand</a>) which gives them that distinctive corn flavor and golden color. You can find this at any Latin grocery store or on Amazon.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<h3>Pro Tip</h3>
<p>If you are short on time, you can absolutely use store-bought empanada discs. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=goya+empanada+discs&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goya and La Saltena</a> both make decent frozen discs. Just thaw them on the counter for 10 minutes before using. They are in the frozen section of most grocery stores.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="beef">Classic Argentine Beef Empanadas</h2>

<p>If there is one empanada recipe you absolutely have to try, it is the Argentine beef empanada. In Argentina, empanadas are practically a religion. Every province has its own version, and people argue about the "right" way to make them the way Americans argue about barbecue.</p>

<p>The classic version comes from the province of Salta, and it is built on a simple formula: good beef, onions, cumin, paprika, and a couple of surprise ingredients that take it to another level.</p>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Argentine Beef Empanada Filling</h3>
<p><strong>Fills about 18-20 empanadas</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 pounds beef (use chuck or sirloin, cut into small cubes, not ground)</li>
<li>3 large white onions, finely diced</li>
<li>3 tablespoons beef fat or vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sweet paprika (pimenton dulce)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (more if you like heat)</li>
<li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</li>
<li>1/2 cup green olives, sliced</li>
<li>Optional: 1/4 cup raisins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Heat the fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the beef cubes in batches. Do not crowd the pan. Remove and set aside. In the same pan, cook the onions with a pinch of salt over medium heat until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the paprika, cumin, oregano, and pepper flakes. Stir for one minute until fragrant. Return the beef to the pan, mix everything together, and season with salt and pepper. Let it cool completely before using. When you are ready to fill, add the chopped hard-boiled eggs and olives to the mixture.</p>
</div>

<p>Two things that are absolutely critical here. First, cut the beef by hand into small cubes instead of using ground beef. In Argentina, nobody uses ground beef for empanadas. Hand-cut beef has a completely different texture. It is chunkier and more satisfying. Second, let the filling cool completely before assembling. Hot filling melts the dough and makes your empanadas impossible to seal.</p>

<p>The hard-boiled egg and olive might sound weird if you have never had them in an empanada before. Trust me on this. That combination of savory beef, salty olive, and creamy egg is what makes Argentine empanadas special. The raisins are traditional in some provinces and add a surprising sweetness that works really well with the cumin.</p>

<h2 id="chicken">Colombian-Style Chicken Empanadas</h2>

<p>Colombian empanadas are a completely different experience from Argentine ones. They are fried instead of baked, the dough is made with corn flour instead of wheat, and the filling is usually shredded chicken mixed with potato. They are the ultimate street food. Crispy on the outside, soft and savory on the inside.</p>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Colombian Chicken Empanada Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 large chicken breasts, boiled and shredded</li>
<li>2 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed</li>
<li>1 large white onion, finely diced</li>
<li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
<li>Chopped cilantro</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Boil the chicken breasts in salted water with a bay leaf until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Shred with two forks. Boil the potatoes until tender, then mash roughly. Saute the onion in oil until soft. Add the cumin and garlic powder. Combine the chicken, potato, onion mixture, green onions, lime juice, and cilantro. Mix well and season with salt and pepper. Let it cool completely.</p>
</div>

<p>The mashed potato in the filling is what holds everything together and gives Colombian empanadas that creamy interior. When you bite through the crunchy corn shell and hit that soft chicken-potato filling, it is seriously one of the best textures in food.</p>

<p>Colombians always serve these with aji, a fresh salsa made from chopped cilantro, green onions, lime juice, vinegar, and a little water. It is the perfect dipping sauce. Takes five minutes to make and completely transforms the empanada.</p>

<h2 id="chilean">Chilean Empanadas de Pino</h2>

<p>Chilean empanadas are the big ones. We are talking the size of your hand, sometimes bigger. The classic version is called empanada de pino, and it is filled with a mixture of ground beef, onions, raisins, a black olive, and a slice of hard-boiled egg. Every empanada gets exactly one olive and one piece of egg. It is tradition.</p>

<div class="recipe-card">
<h3>Chilean Pino Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 pound ground beef</li>
<li>4 large white onions, diced (yes, four, Chileans love their onions)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sweet paprika</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
<li>Black olives (one per empanada)</li>
<li>Hard-boiled eggs, sliced (one slice per empanada)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Cook the onions in oil over medium heat until very soft, about 15 minutes. You want them almost melting. Add the ground beef and break it up. Cook until browned. Add the cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir in the raisins. Let the mixture cool. When assembling, place a spoonful of pino on each disc, then add one olive and one egg slice before folding.</p>
</div>

<p>The ratio of onion to beef in Chilean empanadas is basically 3:1 by weight. It seems like way too much onion when you are cooking, but the onions cook down and become this sweet, jammy base that holds everything together. If you cut back on the onions, it will not taste right.</p>

<h2 id="veggie">Vegetarian and Sweet Empanadas</h2>

<p>Empanadas are not just about meat. Some of the best versions are vegetarian or even sweet.</p>

<h3>Spinach and Cheese (Espinaca y Queso)</h3>
<p>Saute a big bag of fresh spinach with garlic until wilted. Squeeze out all the water (this is important, wet spinach makes soggy empanadas). Mix with ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. This is one of the most popular vegetarian empanadas in Argentina and it is absolutely delicious.</p>

<h3>Corn and Cheese (Humita)</h3>
<p>Humita empanadas are a summer staple. Saute diced onion in butter, add fresh corn kernels cut from the cob, and cook until tender. Mix with gouda or mozzarella cheese. The sweetness of the fresh corn with the melted cheese is incredible.</p>

<h3>Black Bean and Sweet Potato</h3>
<p>Roast cubed sweet potato at 400F until tender. Mash black beans with cumin, garlic, and a little chipotle. Combine with the sweet potato, add some crumbled queso fresco. This one is surprisingly hearty and satisfying.</p>

<h3>Dulce de Leche Empanadas</h3>
<p>The easiest empanada you will ever make. Take your baked empanada dough, fill each one with a spoonful of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=dulce+de+leche&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dulce de leche</a>, seal, bake, and dust with powdered sugar. That is it. These are dangerously good. Keep the filling cold so it does not leak out while sealing.</p>

<h3>Guava and Cream Cheese</h3>
<p>A popular combination in Caribbean and Brazilian cooking. Place a strip of guava paste and a strip of cream cheese on each disc. The guava melts into this sweet, tangy filling while the cream cheese stays creamy. Simple and perfect.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">How to Fold, Seal, and Cook</h2>

<p>Alright, you have got your dough resting in the fridge and your filling is cool. Time for the fun part.</p>

<h3>Rolling and Cutting</h3>
<p>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick. Use a round cutter or a small plate (about 5-6 inches in diameter) to cut circles. You can re-roll the scraps once but do not overwork them.</p>

<h3>Filling</h3>
<p>Place about 2 tablespoons of filling in the center of each disc. Do not overfill. This is the most common mistake people make. You need that half-inch border of clean dough for a good seal. If filling gets on the edge, wipe it off.</p>

<h3>Folding and Sealing</h3>
<p>Brush the edges lightly with beaten egg or water. Fold the dough over to make a half-moon shape. Press the edges firmly with your fingers, then use a fork to crimp all the way around. For a fancier look, try the repulgue: starting at one end, fold a small piece of the edge over itself, pressing as you go, creating a rope-like pattern along the seal.</p>

<h3>Baking</h3>
<p>Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops with beaten egg for a shiny, golden finish. Bake at 400F (200C) for 18-22 minutes until golden brown. Let them cool for 5 minutes before serving because the filling inside is lava hot.</p>

<h3>Frying</h3>
<p>Heat vegetable oil to 350F (175C) in a deep pot or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=deep+fryer+home&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep fryer</a>. Fry 2-3 empanadas at a time (do not crowd the oil or the temperature drops). Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until deep golden. Drain on a wire rack, not paper towels, so the bottom stays crispy.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>Even experienced cooks run into issues with empanadas sometimes. Here are the most common problems and how to fix them.</p>

<h3>The dough cracks when folding</h3>
<p>Your dough is too dry. Add a teaspoon of water at a time and knead briefly. Or it is too cold. Let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. If using store-bought discs, they crack when they are still too frozen.</p>

<h3>The empanadas burst open in the oven or fryer</h3>
<p>This is almost always from overfilling or not sealing the edges well enough. Use less filling and make sure the edges are completely dry and sealed tight. Also poke a tiny vent hole in the top of baked empanadas with a fork so steam can escape.</p>

<h3>The filling is soggy</h3>
<p>Two possible causes. Either the filling was not cool enough when you assembled (steam from hot filling makes dough soggy), or your filling has too much liquid. Drain any excess liquid from the filling before using it. For juicy fillings, add a tablespoon of breadcrumbs to absorb moisture.</p>

<h3>The bottom is soggy on baked empanadas</h3>
<p>Use the bottom rack of the oven and place your baking sheet on a preheated sheet pan. The extra heat from below crisps the bottom. Also make sure you are using parchment paper, not just greasing the pan.</p>

<h3>Fried empanadas are greasy</h3>
<p>The oil was not hot enough. If the oil is below 340F, the dough absorbs oil instead of crisping. Use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kitchen+thermometer&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kitchen thermometer</a> and keep the oil between 340-360F. Do not fry too many at once because each empanada drops the oil temperature.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Essential Tools and Equipment</h2>

<p>You do not need much to make empanadas, but a few tools make the process a lot easier and more consistent.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rolling pin:</strong> Any rolling pin works. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=french+rolling+pin+wood&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">French-style rolling pin</a> (the tapered kind without handles) gives you the most control.</li>
<li><strong>Round cutter:</strong> A 5-inch round cutter or a small bowl works. Consistency in size makes assembly faster.</li>
<li><strong>Baking sheets:</strong> Two large rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper.</li>
<li><strong>Pastry brush:</strong> For egg wash. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=silicone+pastry+brush&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">silicone pastry brush</a> is easiest to clean.</li>
<li><strong>Kitchen thermometer:</strong> Essential for frying. You cannot guess oil temperature accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Wire cooling rack:</strong> For draining fried empanadas. Paper towels make the bottom soggy.</li>
<li><strong>Pastry cutter:</strong> For cutting butter into flour. You can use your hands or two knives, but a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pastry+cutter+blender&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastry cutter</a> is faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly, the only thing you might need to buy is the masarepa if you are making Colombian-style fried empanadas. Everything else is standard kitchen equipment that you probably already have.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<details open>
<summary>What is the secret to authentic empanada dough?</summary>
<p>Cold butter or lard cut into the flour, ice water added slowly, and minimal handling. Overworking the dough makes it tough. The fat should stay in small pieces so the dough puffs and flakes when baked. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before rolling. For fried empanadas, some cooks add a splash of vinegar or white wine to keep it extra crispy.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between baked and fried empanadas?</summary>
<p>Baked empanadas have a flaky, pastry-like crust and are lighter. They are typical of Argentine empanadas. Fried empanadas have a crunchier, golden shell and are more common in Colombian, Venezuelan, and street-vendor styles. Both are authentic depending on the region.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I make empanadas ahead of time and freeze them?</summary>
<p>Yes. Assemble the empanadas, place on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and freeze until solid (about 2 hours). Transfer to a freezer bag. They keep for up to 3 months. Bake frozen empanadas directly from the freezer at 400F for 25-30 minutes. No need to thaw first.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the most popular empanada fillings?</summary>
<p>Beef with onions, cumin, and hard-boiled egg (Argentine style), shredded chicken with peppers and olives, ham and cheese, corn and cheese (humita), and spiced ground pork. Vegetarian options include spinach and cheese, black bean, sweet potato, and mushroom. Sweet empanadas use dulce de leche, guava and cream cheese, or apple and cinnamon.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you seal empanadas so they do not open while cooking?</summary>
<p>Fork-crimp the edges, use the repulgue twist technique, or brush beaten egg on the edges before pressing. The key is not overfilling. Leave a half-inch border of dough, and make sure no filling touches the sealing edge.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What temperature should I bake empanadas at?</summary>
<p>Bake at 400F (200C) for 18-22 minutes until golden brown. If frying, heat oil to 350F (175C) and fry for 3-4 minutes per side. The high oven temperature creates steam that gives you that flaky puff.</p>

<h1>The 15 Best Latin American Recipes You Can Cook at Home in 2026</h1>
<p class="meta">Published February 24, 2026 &middot; 12 min read &middot; By monkey.lat</p>

<p>Latin American cuisine is one of the most diverse and flavorful in the world. From the complex mole sauces of Mexico to the fresh ceviches of Peru, from the hearty feijoada of Brazil to the simple perfection of an Argentine empanada, these recipes span thousands of years of culinary tradition blending indigenous, African, European, and Asian influences.</p>

<p>Every recipe here is authentic. We have sourced them from traditional cooking methods passed down through generations, then adapted them for home cooks who may not have access to specialty Latin markets. Where substitutions are necessary, we note them. Where there are no shortcuts, we tell you that too.</p>

<p>These 15 recipes represent the best of Latin American cooking: dishes that are loved across the continent, have deep cultural significance, and taste extraordinary when made properly.</p>

<h2>1. Ceviche Clasico (Peru)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Lima, Peru</div>
<h3>Peruvian Ceviche</h3>
<p>Ceviche is Peru's national dish and one of the most misunderstood recipes outside Latin America. Real Peruvian ceviche is not the same as the Mexican version with tomato and avocado. It is clean, bright, and intensely citrusy, with the fish "cooked" in lime juice for no more than 15 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb (450g) fresh corvina, sea bass, or halibut, cut into 1 cm cubes</li>
<li>1 cup fresh lime juice (about 10-12 limes)</li>
<li>1 small red onion, thinly sliced into half-moons</li>
<li>1-2 aji limo peppers (or habanero for heat), seeded and minced</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>1 sweet potato, boiled and sliced (for serving)</li>
<li>Canchita (toasted Peruvian corn) or corn nuts (for serving)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Place the fish cubes in a glass bowl. Add the garlic, chile, and a generous pinch of salt. Pour the lime juice over the fish — it should cover the pieces completely. Toss gently. Add the red onion and cilantro. Let sit for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. The fish will turn opaque as the acid denatures the proteins. Do not let it sit longer than 20 minutes or the texture becomes mushy. Serve immediately in shallow bowls with the leche de tigre (the citrus marinade), sweet potato slices, and canchita on the side.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Chef's Tip:</strong> The leche de tigre (tiger's milk) is the leftover citrus marinade. In Peru, it is served as a separate drink or appetizer. Some bars serve it as a hangover cure. The fresher the fish, the better the ceviche — always ask your fishmonger what came in that day.
</div>

<h2>2. Tacos al Pastor (Mexico)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Mexico City, Mexico</div>
<h3>Tacos al Pastor</h3>
<p>Tacos al pastor were born from the fusion of Lebanese shawarma and Mexican spices. Lebanese immigrants arrived in Puebla in the early 1900s and brought their vertical spit-roasting technique. Mexicans replaced lamb with pork, added achiote and dried chiles, and created one of the world's greatest street foods.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 lbs (900g) boneless pork shoulder, sliced thinly (3mm)</li>
<li>4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
<li>2 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
<li>2 tablespoons achiote paste (or 1 tbsp annatto powder)</li>
<li>1/2 cup pineapple juice</li>
<li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1/2 teaspoon cloves</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
<li>1 fresh pineapple, cut into thin rings</li>
<li>Small corn tortillas, white onion (diced), fresh cilantro, salsa verde</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Toast the dried chiles in a dry skillet for 30 seconds per side until fragrant (do not burn). Soak in hot water for 20 minutes until soft. Blend the rehydrated chiles with achiote paste, pineapple juice, vinegar, garlic, cumin, oregano, cloves, and salt until smooth. Marinate the sliced pork in this paste for at least 4 hours, ideally 24 hours in the refrigerator. When ready to cook, heat a cast iron skillet or grill to high heat. Cook the pork slices for 2-3 minutes per side until charred at the edges. Grill the pineapple rings alongside until caramelized. Dice the cooked pork and pineapple. Warm the corn tortillas on a dry skillet. Assemble: tortilla, pastor meat, diced pineapple, onion, cilantro, and salsa verde. Squeeze fresh lime on top.</p>

<h2>3. Empanadas Argentinas de Carne</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Buenos Aires, Argentina</div>
<h3>Argentine Beef Empanadas</h3>
<p>Every province in Argentina has its own empanada style. Salta uses potatoes and is baked. Tucuman is small and fried. The Buenos Aires style below is the most widely recognized, with a juicy beef filling seasoned with cumin and paprika, plus hard-boiled egg and olives for richness.</p>

<p><strong>Dough:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup cold lard or butter, cubed</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Filling:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb ground beef</li>
<li>2 large white onions, finely diced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sweet paprika (pimenton dulce)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon hot paprika or cayenne</li>
<li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</li>
<li>12 green olives, halved</li>
<li>2 scallions, sliced</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Make the dough by cutting the lard into the flour until it resembles coarse sand. Add the egg and warm water, knead briefly until just smooth. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. For the filling, saute onions in oil until soft. Add the beef and brown, breaking into small pieces. Add paprika, cumin, and hot paprika. Season with salt and pepper. Let cool completely — this is critical, as hot filling will make the dough soggy. Fold in chopped eggs and olives. Roll the dough thin and cut into 5-inch circles. Place 2 tablespoons of filling in the center. Fold in half and crimp the edges with a fork or use the traditional repulgue fold. Brush with egg wash. Bake at 400F (200C) for 18-22 minutes until deep golden brown.</p>

<h2>4. Mole Poblano (Mexico)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Puebla, Mexico</div>
<h3>Mole Poblano</h3>
<p>Mole poblano is the most complex sauce in Mexican cuisine. It contains over 20 ingredients including dried chiles, chocolate, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and spices. Making mole is a multi-day process in many Mexican households, often prepared for special occasions like weddings and Day of the Dead celebrations. Legend says it was invented by nuns in a Puebla convent in the 17th century.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6 dried ancho chiles, 4 dried mulato chiles, 3 dried pasilla chiles</li>
<li>3 roma tomatoes, 1 white onion (quartered), 5 cloves garlic (whole)</li>
<li>1/4 cup sesame seeds, 1/4 cup almonds, 1/4 cup peanuts</li>
<li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
<li>1 corn tortilla, torn into pieces</li>
<li>2 oz Mexican chocolate (Abuelita or Ibarra brand)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon each: cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, oregano, cumin</li>
<li>4 cups chicken broth, 3 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons sugar, salt to taste</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Remove stems and seeds from all dried chiles. Toast them in a dry skillet for 30 seconds per side. Soak in hot water for 30 minutes. Roast tomatoes, onion, and garlic under a broiler until blackened. Toast sesame seeds, almonds, peanuts, and raisins in a dry skillet until golden. Fry the torn tortilla pieces until crispy. Blend the rehydrated chiles with 1 cup of their soaking liquid until smooth. In a separate batch, blend the roasted vegetables, toasted nuts, seeds, raisins, fried tortilla, chocolate, and all spices with 1 cup chicken broth. Heat lard in a heavy pot over medium heat. Fry the chile puree, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Add the nut-vegetable blend and stir for another 5 minutes. Add remaining chicken broth, sugar, and salt. Simmer uncovered for 45 minutes to 1 hour, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. The mole should coat the back of a spoon. Serve over roasted turkey or chicken with white rice and warm corn tortillas.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Chef's Tip:</strong> Mole tastes better the next day. Make a big batch and refrigerate it. The flavors meld and deepen overnight. It freezes beautifully for up to 6 months. Leftover mole makes incredible enchiladas.
</div>

<h2>5. Feijoada (Brazil)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</div>
<h3>Brazilian Feijoada</h3>
<p>Feijoada is Brazil's national dish — a rich, slow-cooked black bean stew loaded with smoked and salted pork. It is traditionally served on Saturdays when families and friends gather for a long, leisurely meal. A complete feijoada spread includes rice, collard greens (couve), farofa (toasted cassava flour), orange slices, and a caipirinha to drink.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups (400g) dried black beans, soaked overnight</li>
<li>1 lb smoked pork ribs, cut into sections</li>
<li>1/2 lb carne seca (dried beef) or thick-cut bacon</li>
<li>1/2 lb linguica (Portuguese sausage) or kielbasa</li>
<li>1/4 lb slab bacon</li>
<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>3 bay leaves</li>
<li>Salt and black pepper</li>
<li>Orange slices for serving</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Drain the soaked beans and place in a large heavy pot with fresh water. Add the smoked ribs, dried beef, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2 hours. In a separate skillet, cook the slab bacon until crispy. Add onion and garlic, saute until golden. Slice the linguica and add to the skillet, browning on all sides. Add the skillet contents to the bean pot. Continue simmering for another hour until beans are very tender and the broth is thick. Remove some beans, mash them, and return to the pot to thicken the stew further. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in deep bowls alongside white rice, sauteed collard greens (slice thin, saute with garlic and olive oil), farofa (toast cassava flour in butter with onion), and fresh orange slices. The orange cuts through the richness of the pork.</p>
</div>

<h2>6. Ropa Vieja (Cuba)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Havana, Cuba</div>
<h3>Cuban Ropa Vieja</h3>
<p>Ropa vieja means "old clothes" in Spanish — named because the shredded beef looks like tattered rags. It is Cuba's national dish, a comforting stew of long-braised flank steak pulled into threads and simmered with bell peppers, tomatoes, and olives. The dish actually originated in Spain's Canary Islands before crossing the Atlantic with colonizers.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 lbs flank steak</li>
<li>1 green bell pepper, 1 red bell pepper, sliced into strips</li>
<li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
<li>2 teaspoons cumin, 1 teaspoon oregano, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
<li>1/2 cup pimiento-stuffed green olives</li>
<li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>Salt, pepper, olive oil</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Place the flank steak in a large pot and cover with water. Add 1 bay leaf, half the onion, and salt. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 hours until the meat shreds easily with a fork. Remove the steak and shred it into thin strands along the grain. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Saute the remaining onion, both bell peppers, and garlic until soft, about 8 minutes. Add cumin, oregano, and smoked paprika, stirring for 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes, white wine, reserved cooking liquid, and remaining bay leaf. Simmer for 10 minutes. Add the shredded beef, olives, and capers. Cook for another 20 minutes until the sauce is thick and the flavors have melded. Serve over white rice with fried sweet plantains (maduros) and black beans on the side.</p>
</div>

<h2>7. Arepas Rellenas (Colombia & Venezuela)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Colombia & Venezuela</div>
<h3>Stuffed Arepas</h3>
<p>Arepas are to Colombia and Venezuela what bread is to France. These cornmeal cakes are eaten at every meal and stuffed with everything from cheese to shredded chicken. The Colombian version is thinner and often griddled with cheese (arepa de choclo). The Venezuelan version is thicker and split open like a sandwich. Both are extraordinary.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (Harina P.A.N. brand is essential)</li>
<li>2.5 cups warm water</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter or oil (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Mix the warm water and salt in a bowl. Gradually add the cornmeal, stirring to avoid lumps. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes — it will absorb the water and become workable. Knead until smooth with no cracks. Divide into 6-8 balls. Flatten each ball between your palms into discs about 3/4 inch thick and 4 inches across. Cook on a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium heat for 5-6 minutes per side until a golden crust forms and you hear a hollow sound when tapped. For crispier arepas, transfer to a 350F oven for 10 minutes after griddling. Split open and stuff with reina pepiada (avocado chicken salad), carne mechada (shredded beef), black beans and queso fresco, or simply butter and cheese.</p>
</div>

<h2>8. Pollo a la Brasa (Peru)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Lima, Peru</div>
<h3>Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken</h3>
<p>Peru consumes more chicken per capita than almost any other country in Latin America, and pollo a la brasa is the reason. This rotisserie chicken was invented in Lima in the 1950s by Roger Schuler, a Swiss immigrant. The secret is the marinade: soy sauce (a Peruvian pantry staple from Chinese-Peruvian chifa cuisine), beer, cumin, and aji panca paste create an intensely savory, deeply browned bird.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 whole chicken (3.5-4 lbs)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dark beer</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
<li>1 tablespoon aji panca paste (or 1 tsp ancho chile powder)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Mix all marinade ingredients into a paste. Rub the chicken inside and out. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, ideally overnight. Remove from fridge 1 hour before cooking. Preheat oven to 425F (220C). Place chicken on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Roast for 20 minutes at 425F, then reduce to 375F (190C) and continue roasting for 60-70 minutes until the skin is deeply golden brown and an instant-read thermometer reads 165F in the thickest part of the thigh. Rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve with aji verde sauce (blend jalapeños, cilantro, mayonnaise, lime juice, garlic, and a splash of evaporated milk), french fries, and a simple salad.</p>
</div>

<h2>9. Cochinita Pibil (Mexico)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico</div>
<h3>Slow-Roasted Pork in Banana Leaves</h3>
<p>Cochinita pibil is a Mayan dish that predates the Spanish conquest. The word "pibil" comes from the Mayan word "pib," meaning to cook underground in a pit oven. The pork is marinated in achiote (annatto seed paste) and the juice of bitter Seville oranges, then wrapped in banana leaves and slow-cooked until it falls apart into tender, vibrant orange shreds.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>4 lbs pork shoulder (bone-in for better flavor)</li>
<li>100g achiote paste (Achiote El Yucateco brand)</li>
<li>1 cup bitter orange juice (or 2/3 cup orange juice + 1/3 cup lime juice)</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>Banana leaves (frozen, available at Asian or Latin markets)</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Pickled red onions: 2 red onions (sliced), 1 cup white vinegar, 1 habanero, oregano, salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Blend achiote paste, bitter orange juice, garlic, cumin, oregano, pepper, and salt into a smooth marinade. Score the pork shoulder deeply. Rub the marinade into every cut and crevice. Marinate for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight. Soften banana leaves by passing them over a gas flame or microwaving for 30 seconds. Line a Dutch oven with banana leaves, leaving overhang. Place the marinated pork on top and pour any remaining marinade over it. Fold the banana leaves over to wrap the pork. Cover with the lid. Cook at 300F (150C) for 4-5 hours until the meat falls off the bone. While pork cooks, make pickled onions: bring vinegar to a boil with habanero, oregano, and salt. Pour over sliced red onions and let sit for at least 1 hour. Shred the pork with two forks, mixing in the cooking juices. Serve on corn tortillas with pickled red onions and habanero salsa.</p>
</div>

<h2>10. Lomo Saltado (Peru)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Lima, Peru</div>
<h3>Peruvian Stir-Fried Beef</h3>
<p>Lomo saltado is the signature dish of chifa cuisine — the fusion of Chinese and Peruvian cooking that emerged from Chinese immigration to Peru in the 19th century. It combines the stir-fry technique of Cantonese cooking with Peruvian ingredients like aji amarillo pepper and served, uniquely, with both rice and french fries on the same plate.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 lbs beef tenderloin or sirloin, cut into thick strips</li>
<li>2 red onions, cut into thick wedges</li>
<li>3 roma tomatoes, cut into wedges</li>
<li>1 aji amarillo pepper (or 1 jalapeño), sliced</li>
<li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro, French fries, white rice</li>
<li>Vegetable oil for high-heat cooking</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Cut the beef into thick strips, about 2 inches long. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a wok or large skillet to smoking hot — this is critical for proper searing. Add oil and sear the beef in small batches (do not crowd the pan), about 1 minute per side. Remove and set aside. In the same pan, stir-fry the onion wedges for 2 minutes. Add garlic and aji amarillo for 30 seconds. Add tomato wedges and cook for 1 minute — they should soften slightly but hold their shape. Return the beef to the pan. Add soy sauce and red wine vinegar. Toss everything together for 30 seconds. Garnish with fresh cilantro. Serve immediately with white rice on one side of the plate and crispy french fries on the other. The fries soak up the soy-vinegar sauce.</p>
</div>

<h2>11. Pupusas (El Salvador)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">El Salvador</div>
<h3>Salvadoran Stuffed Corn Cakes</h3>
<p>Pupusas are El Salvador's national dish and one of Central America's most beloved street foods. These thick corn tortillas are stuffed with cheese, beans, or chicharron (ground pork) and cooked on a flat griddle called a comal. They are always served with curtido (a tangy cabbage slaw) and a thin tomato salsa. In 2005, El Salvador declared the second Sunday of November as National Pupusa Day.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups masa harina</li>
<li>1.5 cups warm water</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 cup quesillo or mozzarella, shredded</li>
<li>1 cup refried beans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Mix masa harina, warm water, and salt until a smooth dough forms. It should be moist but not sticky. Take a golf-ball sized piece of dough and flatten it in your palm. Place a tablespoon of cheese and beans in the center. Fold the dough around the filling, seal it, then gently pat it back into a disc about 1/2 inch thick. Cook on an ungreased comal or skillet over medium heat for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown spots appear. Serve hot with curtido (shredded cabbage, carrots, onion, and oregano in vinegar) and salsa roja.</p>
</div>

<h2>12. Carne Asada (Mexico)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Northern Mexico</div>
<h3>Mexican Grilled Beef</h3>
<p>In northern Mexico, particularly Sonora and Chihuahua, carne asada is a way of life. It means simply "grilled meat," but the marinade and technique make it anything but simple. The beef is typically skirt steak or flap meat, marinated in citrus and served with fresh tortillas, guacamole, and salsa.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 lbs skirt steak or flap meat</li>
<li>1/2 cup fresh lime juice</li>
<li>1/4 cup fresh orange juice</li>
<li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 jalapeño, minced</li>
<li>1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin, salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Combine all marinade ingredients. Marinate the steak for 2-4 hours (no longer, or the citrus will break down the meat fibers too much). Remove from fridge 30 minutes before cooking. Grill over very high heat (charcoal is traditional) for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest for 5 minutes, then slice against the grain into thin strips. Serve on warm flour tortillas with guacamole, pico de gallo, grilled onions, and fresh limes.</p>
</div>

<h2>13. Arroz con Pollo (Colombia)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Colombia</div>
<h3>Colombian Chicken and Rice</h3>
<p>Every Latin American country has its own version of arroz con pollo. The Colombian version stands out for its golden color (from achiote or sazon), the addition of beer to the cooking liquid, and the use of long-grain rice that stays fluffy and separate.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>8 chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on)</li>
<li>2 cups long-grain rice</li>
<li>1 bottle (12 oz) Colombian beer (Club Colombia or any lager)</li>
<li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
<li>1 packet sazon with achiote (or 1/2 tsp annatto powder)</li>
<li>Sofrito: 1 onion, 4 cloves garlic, 2 tomatoes, 1 bunch cilantro</li>
<li>1 cup peas, 1 carrot (diced), 1 red bell pepper (diced)</li>
<li>Cumin, salt, pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Season chicken with salt, pepper, and cumin. Brown skin-side down in a large pot for 5 minutes. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, saute the sofrito (diced onion, garlic, chopped tomatoes, cilantro stems) until soft. Add the rice and stir for 2 minutes to coat in the sofrito oil. Add beer, chicken broth, sazon, and salt. Nestle the chicken pieces on top. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low heat. Cover and cook for 25 minutes without lifting the lid. Add peas, carrots, and bell pepper on top. Cover and cook for 5 more minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork. Serve with avocado slices and hogao sauce (saute diced tomatoes and onions in oil with cumin until jammy).</p>

<h2>14. Churrasco with Chimichurri (Argentina)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Buenos Aires, Argentina</div>
<h3>Argentine Grilled Steak with Chimichurri</h3>
<p>Argentina is the land of beef. The asado (barbecue) is a sacred weekend ritual where family gathers around the parrilla (grill) for hours. The key to Argentine grilling is simplicity: salt the meat generously and cook it low and slow over wood or charcoal. The chimichurri sauce — a vibrant mix of parsley, oregano, garlic, vinegar, and olive oil — is the only condiment you need.</p>

<p><strong>Chimichurri:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
<li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
<li>1/3 cup red wine vinegar</li>
<li>2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Combine all chimichurri ingredients and let sit for at least 30 minutes. For the steak, use a 1.5-inch thick ribeye, strip, or entraña (skirt steak). Salt generously on both sides 40 minutes before cooking (this draws out moisture, which then reabsorbs, seasoning the meat deeply). Grill over medium-high heat: 5-6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Rest for 8 minutes before slicing. Spoon chimichurri over each slice. Serve with a simple tomato and onion salad dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar.</p>

<h2>15. Tres Leches Cake (Nicaragua)</h2>

<div class="recipe-card">
<div class="origin">Nicaragua (debated — also claimed by Mexico)</div>
<h3>Three Milks Cake</h3>
<p>Tres leches is the most popular dessert across Latin America. A light sponge cake is soaked in a mixture of three milks: evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream. The result is impossibly moist, sweet, and rich — the kind of dessert that ends every birthday party, quinceañera, and holiday dinner from Mexico to Argentina. Its exact origin is debated, with Nicaragua and Mexico both claiming it.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>5 eggs, separated</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
<li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>Whipped cream and ground cinnamon for topping</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> Preheat oven to 350F. Beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar until pale and thick. Stir in milk and vanilla. Fold in flour gently. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Add remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff peaks. Fold the whites into the yolk mixture in three additions — do not overmix. Pour into a greased 9x13 baking dish. Bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean and the cake springs back when touched. Let cool completely. Mix the three milks together. Pierce the cooled cake all over with a fork (at least 50 holes). Pour the milk mixture slowly over the cake, allowing it to absorb between pours. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Top with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon before serving. The cake should be soaked through but not falling apart.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Chef's Tip:</strong> Tres leches must be served cold. It actually tastes better after 24 hours in the fridge. Add a tablespoon of rum or Kahlua to the milk mixture for an adults-only version.

<h2>Tips for Cooking Latin American Food at Home</h2>

<p><strong>Stock your pantry:</strong> A well-stocked Latin pantry needs only a few essentials: dried chiles (ancho, guajillo, chipotle), cumin, oregano, achiote paste, masa harina, canned chipotles in adobo, and good limes. These ingredients appear across dozens of recipes and last for months.</p>

<p><strong>Use the right corn:</strong> Masa harina (not cornmeal, not polenta) is the correct flour for tortillas, arepas, and pupusas. The brand Harina P.A.N. is standard for arepas. For tortillas and tamales, Maseca is the most widely available brand. They are not interchangeable.</p>

<p><strong>Toast your spices and chiles:</strong> Toasting dried chiles, cumin seeds, and sesame seeds before using them transforms their flavor from flat to complex. This step takes 30 seconds and makes an enormous difference. Use a dry skillet over medium heat and watch carefully — burnt spices are bitter.</p>

<p><strong>Let meat rest:</strong> This applies to all grilled and roasted meats in this guide. Resting allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. Cut too early and those juices end up on your cutting board instead of in your mouth. Rest for at least 5 minutes for steaks, 10 minutes for whole chickens.</p>

<p><strong>Acid is your friend:</strong> Latin American cooking uses acid (lime juice, vinegar, sour oranges) not just for flavor but as a tenderizer, a cooking method (ceviche), and a brightness element that balances rich, fatty dishes. Always have fresh limes on hand.</p>

<p><strong>Respect the recipe first, then experiment:</strong> Make each recipe exactly as written the first time. After you understand the flavors and techniques, adjust to your taste. Substitutions can work, but understanding the original is essential before you improvise.</p>
